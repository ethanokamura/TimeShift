## General Idea
- Social network calendar app
- Add friends and find when everyone is free
- Link your personal calendars
- Block out “me time”
- See events
- See local events (promoted by local businesses)
- Hard and soft events (greyed out time blocks) “penciled in”

## MVP
- Integrate with existing clock
- Add friends
- **Burnout Bar (public/public)**
- Invite people to new events
- Block out me time
- default list of  calming activities for when people are getting burned out (add a custom list of activities that can cause people to recover from burn out)
- events that are recurring (basic calendar functionality)


## Future Ideas
- commute time added to the beginning and end of an event because then you can manage where you need to be and when (might need a google calendar integration)
- perhaps a marketplace for possible customization features for the calendar? like how discord has with emotes
- get our users to understand that we want to block out their sleep schedule I want to cater to the people who track everything
- perhaps a constant tracking part of the program that constantly monitors what your devices are and what you are actually doing on your phone to make sure that you are getting stuff done
- social features —> requires the implementation of a direct messaging component?

—> integration with whatsapp, instagram and discord by default this is using our own forked version of signal (if it is good enough for the secretary of defense it is good enough for me) 

- database of how long specific things take, ie you are in a 5 unit cs class how long will it take you to do the homework
- integrate with epic, cerner and Allscripts to allow you to schedule appointments directly with your doctor’s office (far off I know)
- I mean I would like there to be like a google doodle thing for holidays, it would be fun
- support for the ical and csv formats
- differing timezone support for businesses, allow to make calls with both japan and new york that work for everyone’s schedule
- leaving people notes for specific times  that they only see after a specific time
- Calendar groups: basically have there be events that are specifically for people who are at at specific events
- integration with dayforce, Workday, and other HCM software that allow people to manage their schedule for their actual work
- add Microsoft Office calendar functionality for businesses (they all use it, I hate it)
- integration with emails to track when specific things are coming and arriving at a specific location
- to do list that lists all
